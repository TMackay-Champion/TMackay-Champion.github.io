I am a research seismologist at the University of Oxford. I am interested in improving our understanding of the fundamental geological, chemical, and physical processes governing the formation of ore deposits and geothermal resources through time and space, and in developing new geophysical tools for locating and evaluating these resources with minimal environmental impact. I have experience with ambient noise tomography (finite-frequency inversions and eikonal), receiver function analysis, earthquake spectral analysis, petrological modelling, field geology, and geochemistry. I am proficient in MATLAB, Python, and Julia coding languages. I have experience with a range of seismic instruments, including conventional broadband seismometers such as the Guralp CMG-ESPCD and novel seismic nodes (e.g., Sercel WiNG, Stryde accelerometer, SmartSOLO geophones).

Many of my projects rely on code written in MATLAB, Julia or Python. Some of my code can be found on my [GitHub page]([https://pages.github.com](https://github.com/TMackay-Champion)).
