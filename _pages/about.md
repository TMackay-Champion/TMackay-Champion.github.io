I am a research seismologist at the University of Oxford, interested in advancing our understanding of the geological, chemical, and physical processes that control the formation of ore deposits and geothermal resources over time and space. My work focuses on developing geophysical tools to locate and examine these resources with minimal environmental impact.

## Methods
I have experience with:
- ambient noise tomography (finite-frequency inversions and eikonal)
- receiver function analysis
- earthquake spectral analysis
- petrological modelling
- field geology
- geochemistry

## Tools
Many of my projects rely on code written in MATLAB, Julia or Python. Some of my code can be found on my [GitHub page]([https://pages.github.com](https://github.com/TMackay-Champion)).
